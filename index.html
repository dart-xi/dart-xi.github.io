    <h3>Monday 05/06</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:00–09:45</time> Boulier: Algebra and Kolchin’s Irreducibility Theorem</summary>In this talk, I will present two subjects on which I have worked recently: the DifferentialAlgebra project, which is an open source software dedicated to the elimination theory in Differential Algebra, based on the BLAD libraries, and hosted in the git repository https://codeberg.org/francois.boulier/DifferentialAlgebra and a joint work with colleagues from Univ. Lille and Univ. Rennes which aims at reformulating Kolchin's proof of the Irreducibility Theorem given in [Kolchin1973, Chap. IV, Proposition 10, page 200] using Arc Schemes. The Arc Schemes aspects of this joint work will however not be addressed in this talk.</details></li>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:55–10:40</time> Freitag: Binding Groups and Differential Algebra</summary>We will survey some of the work from the past several years on new connections between the model theory of groups and differential equations. Following the setup, we will discuss algebraic relations between solutions of several different differential equations, proving a conjecture of Borovik-Deloro in the setting of differentially closed fields, and several open problems. </details></li>
      <li><time>10:40–11:40</time> Coffee</li>
      <li><details><summary><time>11:40–12:25</time> Romanovski: Integrability of Polynomial Vector Fields</summary>We discuss the  problem of local  integrability  of polynomial vector fields in a neighborhood of resonant  singular point. The main attention is paid to the case of planar vector fields with \(1:-1\) resonant singular points. An efficient  method to compute the necessary conditions of integrability based on a specific grading of the formal power series module and reducing to a difference equation is presented. A few mechanisms of integrability are described. A connection to the local 16th Hilbert problem is mentioned.

      <li><details><summary><time>15:00–15:45</time> Dufresne: Structural and Practical Identifiability of ERK Kinetics</summary>This talk is based on a paper written in collaboration with Lewis Marsh, Helen Byrne and Heather Harrington, where we explored the algebra, geometry and topology of ERK kinetics. The MEK/ERK signalling pathway is involved in cell division, cell specialisation, survival and cell death. We studied a polynomial dynamical system describing the dynamics of MEK/ERK proposed by Yeung et al. with their experimental setup, data and known biological information. The experimental dataset is a time-course of ERK measurements in different phosphorylation states following activation of either wild-type MEK or MEK mutations associated with cancer or developmental defects. My focus in this talk will be on identifiability, both structural and practical. Structurally identifiable is concerned with asking whether parameter values can be recovered from perfect data. Practical identifiability addresses the more realistic situation where we assume there is measurement noise. We observe that the original model is structurally but not practically identifiable. We will discuss how algebraic quasi-steady state approximation leads to a smaller simpler model which is both structurally and practically identifiable, while providing a probable explanation for the practical non-identifiability of the original model.</details></li>

    <ul>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:00–09:45</time> Ceccherini-Silberstein: An Invitation to Symbolic Dynamics on Groups</summary>The purpose of this talk is to present an introduction to symbolic dynamics (subshifts and cellular automata) where the universe is a general group.
Group properties such as amenability (a notion going back to von Neumann (1929)) and soficity (introduced by Gromov and B. Weiss (1999)) play a fundamental role in the interplay between the geometric, combinatorial, and algebraic properties of the acting group and the dynamical properties of the corresponding symbolic dynamical systems. I'll discuss the Garden of Eden theorem and the Gromov-Weiss surjunctivity theorem and their linear versions as well as the relation with a celebrated conjecture by Kaplansky on the structure of group rings.</details></li>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:55–10:40</time> Phung: Some interactions between Algebra, Groups, and Symbolic Dynamics</summary> My talk continues the presentation of Tullio Ceccherini-Silberstein and discusses some further interactions between algebra and symbolic dynamics on groups. I will first explain how to use linear symbolic dynamics to obtain a new conceptual proof of Hall's theorem on the Notherianity of the group algebra \(k[G]\)for every polycyclic-by-finite group \(G\). Then I will discuss some recent work on the interplay between extensions of the Garden of Eden theorem, the Gromov-Weiss surjunctivity theorem, and a conjecture of Kaplansky on the structure of group rings.</details></li>

      <li><details><summary><time>15:00–15:45</time> Roques: Around Mahler Equations</summary>In this talk, we will report on some recent results about linear Mahler equations. We will notably speak about automata, difference Galois theory, Hahn series. No prerequisite is required.</details></li>

    <h3>Wednesday 07/06</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:00–09:45</time> Chen: Dynamics in Symbolic Integration and Summation</summary>This talk aims at motivating a dynamical aspect of symbolic integration and summation by studying some stability problems on iterated integration and summation of special functions. We first show some basic properties of stable functions in differential and difference fields and then characterize several special families of stable functions including rational functions, logarithmic functions, hyperexponential functions and hypergeometric terms. After that, we prove that all D-finite power series and P-recursive sequences are eventually stable. Some problems for future studies are proposed towards deeper dynamical studies in differential and difference algebra. This talk is based on my recent work joint with Ruyong Feng, Zewang Guo, Xiuyun Li and Wei Lu.</details></li>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:55–10:40</time> Jaoui: On the Density of Strongly Minimal Algebraic Vector Fields</summary>The notion of strongly minimal algebraic differential equation is one of the central concepts lying at the intersection between differential algebra and model theory.  While already in the nineties, Hrushovski and Sokolovic obtained a robust classification of the transcendance properties of the solutions of such algebraic differential equations, a key difficulty that remains is to produce interesting families of  algebraic differential equations to which this classification can be applied.
        <p>I will describe a recent result which states that “almost all” complex algebraic vector fields  (in a sense that will be made precise in my talk)  are strongly minimal.  One of the key ingredients behind the stage is a geometric analysis of complex algebraic vector fields with at least one non resonant singular point that I will explain precisely during my talk.<\p> </details></li>
      <li><time>10:40–11:40</time> Coffee</li>
      <li><details><summary><time>11:40–12:25</time> Bortner: Identifiability of Linear Compartmental Tree Models</summary>Recovering parameter values from mathematical models is a primary interest of those that use them to model the physical and biological world.  This recovery, or <em>identification</em>, of parameters within models, is also an interesting mathematical problem that we call <em>Identifiability</em>.  In this talk, we will explore the identifiability of a specific type of model called Linear Compartmental Models using an algebraic and combinatoric approach. </details></li>
      <li><time>12:25</time> Free afternoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Thursday 08/06</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:00–09:45</time> Joldes: On Moment Problems with Holonomic Functions</summary>Many reconstruction algorithms from moments of algebraic data were developed in optimization, analysis or statistics. Lasserre and Putinar proposed an exact reconstruction algorithm for the algebraic support of the Lebesgue measure, or of measures with density equal to the exponential of a known polynomial. Their approach relies on linear recurrences for the moments, obtained using Stokes theorem. In this talk, we discuss an extension of this study to measures with holonomic densities and support with real algebraic boundary. Based on the framework of holonomic distributions and Stokes theorem, our approach computes recurrences for the moments which stay linear w.r.t the coefficients of the polynomial vanishing over the support boundary. This property allows for an efficient reconstruction method (from sufficiently many moments) for both these coefficients and those of the polynomials involved in the holonomic operators which annihilate the density, by solving linear systems only. This is a joint work with Florent Bréhard and Jean-Bernard Lasserre.</details></li>
      <li><details><summary><time>09:55–10:40</time> Casale: Algebraic Relations between Solutions of a Differential Equations</summary>In 2004, K. Nishioka proved that if \(y_1,\dots, y_n\) are solutions of \(P_1 : y''= 6 y^2 + x\) and \(\mathrm{tr.deg.}_{C(x)}C(x, y_1,y'_1,\dots, y_n,y'_n) < 2n\), then there exists \(i < j\) such that \(y_i = y_j\). This result was generalized to other Painlevé equation by Nagloo-Pillay.
        In this talk I will explain how the Galois groupoid of a differential equation can be used to study the algebraic relations between its solutions. Assume a second order equation has a primitive, simple, infinite dimensional Galois groupoid, if \(y_1,..., y_n\) are solutions and \(\mathrm{tr.deg.}_{C(x)}C(x,y_1, y'_1,\dots, y_n, y'_n) < 2n\) then 
        <ol>
        <li> there exist \(i\) such that \(\mathrm{tr.deg.}_{C(x)}(y_i,y'_i) < 2\), or </li>
        <li>there exist \(i < j\) such that \(C(x,y_i,y'_i)^{\mathrm{alg}} = C(x, y_j,y'_j)^{\mathrm{alg}}\).</li> </ol> </details></li>

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    <p>Due to rapidly increasing prices for summer 2023 in London, participants are encouraged to book their accommodation as early as possible.
      The key is to shop around, and not to worry if you find a hotel which is several tube or bus stops away, the transportaion is usually very efficient.
      The organisers would like to point out the following options among the huge variety of other possibilities.</p>
    <p>Speakers and participants expecting to be reimbursed by QMUL should book at most 3* hotels.</p>

    <h2>The DART series</h2>
    <p>Based on the foundational works of Joseph Fels Ritt and Ellis Robert Kolchin, differential algebra has evolved
      into an extremely rich subject during the last two decades. <strong>Differential Algebra and Related
        Topics</strong> (DART) is a series of workshops which offer an opportunity for participants to present original
      research, to learn of research progress and new developments, and to exchange ideas and views on differential
      algebra and related topics. The eleventh addition of the DART series will be hosted in the School of Mathematical
      Sciences at Queen Mary University of London.</p>
